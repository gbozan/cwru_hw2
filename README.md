This homework assignment aimed to build VBA scripting skills by creating a script to analyze stock market data. It provided experience with automating data analysis in Excel, reinforcing programming basics and Excel functions.
My task was to write a VBA script that processes stock data for each quarter, capturing details like ticker symbols, quarterly and percentage changes, and total volume for each stock. I also added extra features to the script to identify stocks with the highest percentage increase, biggest decrease, and largest total volume. I used conditional formatting to make it clear which stocks had positive changes (highlighted in green) and which had negative changes (in red). To test the script, I ran it on a smaller dataset to make sure it worked correctly across all sheets. Once everything was done, I uploaded screenshots, the VBA script, and a README file to GitHub.
This assignment gave me hands on experience with VBA programming, loop structures, and data manipulation while showing how automation can make repetitive tasks faster and easier. By learning to use VBA in Excel, I got a sense of how programming can help with data analysis. I also got better at debugging and gained some solid basics in handling data in programming.
